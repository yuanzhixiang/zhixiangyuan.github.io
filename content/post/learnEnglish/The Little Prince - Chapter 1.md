Once when I was six years old I saw a magnificent picture in a book, called True Stories from Nature, about the primeval forest. It was a picture of a boa constrictor in the act of swallowing an animal. Here is a copy of the drawing.

```
词汇：
    1. magnificent adj. 华丽的
    2. primeval adj. 原始的
    3. boa constrictor 大蟒蛇
    4. swallow v. 吞下
    5. once 有一次
```

In the book it said: "Boa constrictors swallow their prey whole, without chewing it."

```
词汇：
    1. prey n. 猎物
    2. chew v. 咀嚼
```

After that they are not able to move, and they sleep through the six months that they need for digestion." I pondered deeply, then, over the adventures of the jungle. And after some work with a colored pencil I succeeded in making my first drawing. My Drawing Number One. It looked like this: 

![like this](/media/learnEnglish/2.png)

```
词汇：
    1. digestion n. 消化
    2. ponder v. 思考
    3. ponder over 思考
```

I showed my masterpiece to the grown-ups, and asked them whether the drawing frightened them. But they answered: "Frighten? Why should any one be frightened by a hat?" My drawing was not a picture of a hat. It was a picture of a boa constrictor digesting an elephant.

```
词汇：
    1. masterpiece n. 杰作
    2. grown-ups n. 成年人
```

But since the grown-ups were not able to understand it, I made another drawing: I drew the inside of the boa constrictor, so that the grown-ups could see it clearly. They always need to have things explained. My Drawing Number Two looked like this: 

![like this](/media/learnEnglish/3.png)

```
词汇：
    1. since 因为
```

The grown-ups' response, this time, was to advise me to lay aside my drawings of boa constrictors, whether from the inside or the outside, and devote myself instead to geography, history, arithmetic and grammar.

```
词汇：
    1. lay aside sth 把 sth 放到一边
    2. devote oneself to 致力于
    3. geography n. 地理
    4. arithmetic n. 算法
```

That is why, at the age of six, I gave up what might have been a magnificent career as a painter. I had been disheartened by the failure of my Drawing Number One and my Drawing Number Two. Grown-ups never understand anything by themselves, and it is tiresome for children to be always and forever explaining things to them.

```
词汇：
    1. disheartened adj. 沮丧的
    2. tiresome adj. 烦人的 
    3. always and forever 两个表示频率的词连用用来加重语气
语法：
    1. might have done 虚拟语气，表示一种与现在不同的情况
    2. had been disheartened 这里的语法是 had done + adj，没有 had been done 这一说，
    而有 had been doing 这个过去完成进行时
```

So then I chose another profession, and learned to pilot airplanes. I have flown a little over all parts of the world; and it is true that geography has been very useful to me. At a glance I can distinguish China from Arizona. If one gets lost in the night, such knowledge is valuable. In the course of this life I have had a great many encounters with a great many people who have been concerned with matters of consequence.

```
词汇：
    1. Arizona n. 亚利桑那州，地名
    2. encounters v.遭遇
    3. So then 那么
    4. profession n. 职业
    5. flown v. fly 的过去分词
    6. poilt v. 驾驶
    7. airplane n. 飞机，这里之所以用复数形式，是因为 airplane 是可数名词，
    可数名词前面要么加冠词，要么加 s 变复数
    8. gets lost 迷路
    9. a great many people 很多人
    10. consequence n. 重要性
    11. matters of consequence 重要的事情
语法：
    1. have had 其中 have done 表示现在完成时， had 表示拥有
    2. I have flown a little over all parts of the world，have done 表示现在完成时，
    其中 a little 修饰前面的 flown，表示飞过一点，all parts of the world 表示世界各
    地，也就是在世界各地都飞过一点。
```

I have lived a great deal among grown-ups. I have seen them intimately, close at hand. And that hasn't much improved my opinion of them. Whenever I met one of them who seemed to me at all clear-sighted, I tried the experiment of showing him my Drawing Number One, which I have always kept. I would try to find out, so, if this was a person of true understanding. But, whoever it was, he, or she, would always say:" That is a hat."
