As each day passed I would learn, in our talk, something about the little prince's planet, his departure from it, his journey. The information would come very slowly, as it might chance to fall from his thoughts. It was in this way that I heard, on the third day, about the catastrophe of the baobabs.

```
词汇：
    1. chance v. 偶然发生

    4. departure n. 离开
    5. catastrophe n. 大灾难
    6. baobabs n. 猴面包树
```

This time, once more, I had the sheep to thank for it. For the little prince asked me abruptly-- as if seized by a grave doubt— "It is true, isn't it, that sheep eat little bushes?"

```
词汇：
    1. abruptly adv. 唐突地
    2. seized v. 逮住，seize 的过去分词
    3. grave adj. 重大的
    4. doubt n. 疑点
    5. bushes n. 灌木
    6. once more 又是
```

"Yes, that is true."

"Ah! I am glad!" I did not understand why it was so important that sheep should eat little bushes. But the little prince added:

"Then it follows that they also eat baobabs?" I pointed out to the little prince that baobabs were not little bushes, but, on the contrary, trees as big as castles; and that even if he took a whole herd of elephants away with him, the herd would not eat up one single baobab.

```
词汇：
    1. glad adj. 高兴
    2. contrary adj. 相反的
    3. castles n. 城堡
    4. herd n. 兽群
```

The idea of the herd of elephants made the little prince laugh. "We would have to put them one on top of the other," he said. But he made a wise comment: "Before they grow so big, the baobabs start out by being little." 

```

    1. start out 生命开始的时候

"That is strictly correct," I said. "But why do you want the sheep to eat the little baobabs?"

He answered me at once, "Oh, come, come!", as if he were speaking of something that was self-evident（显而易见的）. And I was obliged to make a great mental effort to solve this problem, without any assistance. Indeed, as I learned, there were on the planet where the little prince lived-- as on all planets-- good plants and bad plants.

```
词汇：
    1. strictly adv. 严格地，完全地
    2. self-evident 显而易见的
    3. mental adj. 头脑的
    4. indeed adv. 事实上
语法：
    1. be obliged to 必须做某事
    2. make a great effort to do 费力做某事
    3. oh, come, come! 唉，这还用说
```

In consequence, there were good seeds from good plants, and bad seeds from bad plants. But seeds are invisible. They sleep deep in the heart of the earth's darkness, until some one among them is seized with the desire to awaken. Then this little seed will stretch itself and begin—timidly at first-- to push a charming little sprig inoffensively upward toward the sun.

```
1. in consequence 因此
2. stretch v. 伸展
3. timidly adv. 胆怯地
4. inoffensively adv. 无害地
5. charm n. 魅力
6. charming adj. 迷人的
7. sprig n. 枝丫
```

If it is only a sprout of radish or the sprig of a rose bush, one would let it grow wherever it might wish. But when it is a bad plant, one must destroy it as soon as possible, the very first instant that one recognizes it. Now there were some terrible seeds on the planet that was the home of the little prince; and those were the seeds of the baobab. 

```
1. sprout v. 发芽
2. radish n. 小萝卜
3. as soon as possible 尽快
```

The soil of that planet was infested with them. A baobab is something you will never, never be able to get rid of if you attend to it too late. It spreads over the entire planet. It bores clear through it with its roots. And if the planet is too small, and the baobabs are too many, they split it in pieces...

```
1. soil n. 土壤
2. bore v. 打通
3. infested v. 大批量滋生
4. get rid of 摆脱
5. spread v. 传播
```

"It is a question of discipline," the little prince said to me later on. "When you've finished your own toilet in the morning, then it is time to attend to the toilet of your planet, just so, with the greatest care. You must see to it that you pull up regularly all the baobabs, at the very first moment when they can be distinguished from the rosebushes which they resemble so closely in their earliest youth.

```
1. discipline n. 纪律
2. toilet v. 梳洗
3. pull up 拔起d
4. regularly adv. 定期地
5. rosebushes n. 蔷薇丛
6. resemble v. 类似
```

It is very tedious work," the little prince added, "but very easy." And one day he said to me: "You ought to make a beautiful drawing, so that the children where you live can see exactly how all this is. That would be very useful to them if they were to travel some day.

```
1. tedious adj. 单调乏味的
2. ought to 应当
```

Sometimes," he added, "there is no harm in putting off some work until another day. But when it is a matter of baobabs, that always means a catastrophe. I knew a planet that was inhabited by a lazy man. He neglected three little bushes..."

```
1. neglected adj. 被忽视的
```

So, as the little prince described it to me, I have made a drawing of that planet. I do not much like to take the tone of a moralist. But the danger of the baobabs is so little understood, and such considerable risks would be run by anyone who might get lost on an asteroid, that for once I am breaking through my reserve.

```
1. moralist n. 道德家
2. little understood 难以理解
3. for once 仅这一次
4. reserve n. 惯例
```

"Children," I say plainly, "watch out for the baobabs!" My friends, like myself, have been skirting this danger for a long time, without ever knowing it; and so it is for them that I have worked so hard over this drawing. The lesson which I pass on by this means is worth all the trouble it has cost me.

```
1. skirting 在...的边缘
```

Perhaps you will ask me, "Why are there no other drawing in this book as magnificent and impressive as this drawing of the baobabs?" The reply is simple. I have tried. But with the others I have not been successful. When I made the drawing of the baobabs I was carried beyond myself by the inspiring force of urgent necessity.

```
1. inspiring adj. 鼓舞人心的
2. urgent adj. 紧急的
```

Oh, little prince! Bit by bit I came to understand the secrets of your sad little life... For a long time you had found your only entertainment in the quiet pleasure of looking at the sunset. I learned that detail on the morning of the fourth day, when you said to me: "I am very fond of（喜爱） sunsets. Come, let us go look at a sunset now."

```
1. entertainment n. 娱乐
```

"But we must wait," I said.

"Wait? For what?"

"For the sunset. We must wait until it is time."    

At first you seemed to be very much surprised. And then you laughed to yourself. You said to me: "I am always thinking that I am at home!" Just so. Everybody knows that when it is noon in the United States the sun is setting over France.

```
1. set v. 落下
2. over prep. 在另一边
3. tiny adj. 微小的
```

If you could fly to France in one minute, you could go straight into the sunset, right from noon. Unfortunately, France is too far away for that. But on your tiny planet, my little prince, all you need to do is move your chair a few steps.

You can see the day end and the twilight falling whenever you like... "One day," you said to me, "I saw the sunset forty-four times!" And a little later you added:

"You know-- one loves the sunset, when one is so sad..." "Were you so sad, then?" I asked, "on the day of the forty-four sunsets?" But the little prince made no reply.

```
1. twilight n. 黄昏
