Once when I was six years old I saw a magnificent picture in a book, called True Stories from Nature, about the primeval forest. It was a picture of a boa constrictor in the act of swallowing an animal. Here is a copy of the drawing. 

![swallowing an animal](/media/learnEnglish/1.png)

```
词汇：
    1. magnificent adj. 华丽的
    2. primeval adj. 原始的
    3. boa constrictor 大蟒蛇
    4. swallow v. 吞下
    5. once 有一次
    6. called 被称为
```

In the book it said: "Boa constrictors swallow their prey whole, without chewing it."

```
词汇：
    1. prey n. 猎物
    2. chew v. 咀嚼
```

After that they are not able to move, and they sleep through the six months that they need for digestion." I pondered deeply, then, over the adventures of the jungle. And after some work with a colored pencil I succeeded in making my first drawing. My Drawing Number One. It looked like this: 

![like this](/media/learnEnglish/2.png)

```
词汇：
    1. digestion n. 消化
    2. ponder v. 思考
    3. ponder over 思考
```

I showed my masterpiece to the grown-ups, and asked them whether the drawing frightened them. But they answered: "Frighten? Why should any one be frightened by a hat?" My drawing was not a picture of a hat. It was a picture of a boa constrictor digesting an elephant.

```
词汇：
    1. masterpiece n. 杰作
    2. grown-ups n. 成年人
```

But since the grown-ups were not able to understand it, I made another drawing: I drew the inside of the boa constrictor, so that the grown-ups could see it clearly. They always need to have things explained. My Drawing Number Two looked like this: 

![like this](/media/learnEnglish/3.png)

```
词汇：
    1. since 因为
```

The grown-ups' response, this time, was to advise me to lay aside my drawings of boa constrictors, whether from the inside or the outside, and devote myself instead to geography, history, arithmetic and grammar.

```
词汇：
    1. lay aside sth 把 sth 放到一边
    2. devote oneself to 致力于
    3. geography n. 地理
    4. arithmetic n. 算法
```

That is why, at the age of six, I gave up what might have been a magnificent career as a painter. I had been disheartened by the failure of my Drawing Number One and my Drawing Number Two. Grown-ups never understand anything by themselves, and it is tiresome for children to be always and forever explaining things to them.

```
词汇：
    1. disheartened adj. 沮丧的
    2. tiresome adj. 烦人的 
    3. always and forever 两个表示频率的词连用用来加重语气
语法：
    1. might have done 虚拟语气，表示一种与现在不同的情况
    2. had been disheartened 这里的语法是 had done + adj，没有 had been done 这一说，
    而有 had been doing 这个过去完成进行时
```

So then I chose another profession, and learned to pilot airplanes. I have flown a little over all parts of the world; and it is true that geography has been very useful to me. At a glance I can distinguish China from Arizona. If one gets lost in the night, such knowledge is valuable. In the course of this life I have had a great many encounters with a great many people who have been concerned with matters of consequence.

```
词汇：
    1. Arizona n. 亚利桑那州，地名
    2. encounters v.遭遇
    3. So then 那么
    4. profession n. 职业
    5. flown v. fly 的过去分词
    6. poilt v. 驾驶
    7. airplane n. 飞机，这里之所以用复数形式，是因为 airplane 是可数名词，
    可数名词前面要么加冠词，要么加 s 变复数
    8. gets lost 迷路
    9. a great many people 很多人
    10. consequence n. 重要性
    11. matters of consequence 重要的事情
语法：
    1. have had 其中 have done 表示现在完成时， had 表示拥有
    2. I have flown a little over all parts of the world，have done 表示现在完成时，
    其中 a little 修饰前面的 flown，表示飞过一点，all parts of the world 表示世界各
    地，也就是在世界各地都飞过一点。
```

I have lived a great deal among grown-ups. I have seen them intimately, close at hand. And that hasn't much improved my opinion of them. Whenever I met one of them who seemed to me at all clear-sighted, I tried the experiment of showing him my Drawing Number One, which I have always kept. I would try to find out, so, if this was a person of true understanding. But, whoever it was, he, or she, would always say:" That is a hat."

```
词汇：
    1. live among 在...中生活
    2. a great deal 译为许多等同于 a lot
    3. intimately 熟悉地
    4. close at hand 近在咫尺
    5. clear-sighted 头脑清楚
    6. at all 表示程度位置比较灵活
    7. try v. 尝试
    8. experiment n. 实验
    9. kept 是 keep 的过去式和过去分词
语法：
    1. whenever 表示每当、一...就，用法与 when 用法相似，但语气更强。其中又套了个定语
    从句 who seemed to me al all clear-sighted 修饰先行词 one。
```

Then I would never talk to that person about boa constrictors, or primeval forests, or stars. I would bring myself down to his level. I would talk to him about bridge, and golf, and politics, and neckties. And the grown-up would be greatly pleased to have met such a sensible man.

```
词汇：
    1. politics n. 政治
    2. neckites n. 领带
    3. sensible adj. 通情达理的
语法：
    1. bring down 降低到他的层次，这句话里面带着明显的主观情绪，“我”看不上那些没有想象
    力，碌碌无为的大人们。

```

So I lived my life alone, without anyone that I could really talk to, until I had an accident with my plane in the Desert of Sahara, six years ago. Something was broken in my engine. And as I had with me neither a mechanic nor any passengers, I set myself to attempt the difficult repairs all alone. It was a question of life or death for me: I had scarcely enough drinking water to last a week.

```
词汇：
    1. as 由于
    2. alone 强调数量上的单一，lonely 意思是哪次呢的孤单
语法：
    1. neither...nor... 这个词组表示“既没有...也没有..."
    2. set oneself to attempt 某人尝试做某事
```

The first night, then, I went to sleep on the sand, a thousand miles from any human habitation. I was more isolated than a shipwrecked sailor on a raft in the middle of the ocean. Thus you can imagine my amazement, at sunrise, when I was awakened by an odd little voice. It said: "If you please-- draw me a sheep!"

```

    1. habitation n. 居住地
    2. shipwrecked adj. 遭遇海难的
    3. sailor n. 水手

    7. odd adj. 奇怪的
语法：
    1. more...than... 比...更...，文中的 more isolated than a shipwrecked sailor 表示比木筏上的水手更绝望。
```

"What!"

"Draw me a sheep!" I jumped to my feet, completely thunderstruck. I blinked my eyes hard. I looked carefully all around me. And I saw a most extraordinary small person, who stood there examining me with great seriousness.

```
词汇：
    1. thunderstruck adj. 遭雷击的
    2. blink v. 眨眼
    3. extrodinary adj. 离奇的

```

Here you may see the best portrait that, later, I was able to make of him. But my drawing is certainly very much less charming than its model. That, however, is not my fault. The grown-ups discouraged me in my painter's career when I was six years old, and I never learned to draw anything, except boas from the outside and boas from the inside. 

```
词汇：
    1. boas n. 蟒蛇
    2. portrait n. 肖像
    3. charm n. 魅力
语法：
    except from 除...之外
```

Now I stared at this sudden apparition with my eyes fairly starting out of my head in astonishment. Remember, I had crashed in the desert a thousand miles from any inhabited region. And yet my little man seemed neither to be straying uncertainly among the sands, nor to be fainting from fatigue or hunger or thirst or fear. Nothing about him gave any suggestion of a child lost in the middle of the desert, a thousand miles from any human habitation.

```
词汇：
    1. apparition n. 幽灵，离奇出现的东西
    2. sudden adj. 突然的
    3. astonishment n. 令人惊讶的事物
    4. inhabited adj. 有人居住的
    5. fairly adv. 简直，表示强调
语法：
    1. start out of 从...中离开，文中 my eyes fairly starting out of my head 表示我的眼睛简直要
    从头上飞出去
    2. give suggestion of... 这里的 suggestion 不是给出建议的意思，而是线索
    3. 最后一句的意思是没有任何线索显示出这是一个失落在沙漠中心的孩子
```

When at last I was able to speak, I said to him:"But-- what are you doing here?"

And in answer he repeated, very slowly, as if he were speaking of a matter of great consequence: "If you please-- draw me a sheep..." When a mystery is too overpowering（不可抗拒的）, one dare not disobey. Absurd as it might seem to me, a thousand miles from any human habitation and in danger of death, I took out of my pocket a sheet of paper and my fountain-pen（钢笔）.

```

    1. overpowering adj. 不可抗拒的
    2. consequence n. 结论

    7. fountain-pen n. 钢笔

    1. a mater of consequence 重要的事情
```

But then I remembered how my studies had been concentrated on geography, history, arithmetic, and grammar, and I told the little chap (a little crossly, too) that I did not know how to draw. He answered me:"That doesn't matter. Draw me a sheep..." But I had never drawn a sheep. So I drew for him one of the two pictures I had drawn so often.

```
词汇：
    1. chap n. 小家伙
```

It was that of the boa constrictor from the outside. And I was astounded to hear the little fellow greet it with, "No, no, no! I do not want an elephant inside a boa constrictor. A boa constrictor is a very dangerous creature, and an elephant is very cumbersome. Where I live, everything is very small. What I need is a sheep. Draw me a sheep." So then I made a drawing. 

```
词汇：
    1. cumbersome adj. 笨重的
```

He looked at it carefully, then he said: "No. This sheep is already very sickly. Make me another." So I made another drawing. 

```
词汇：
    1. sickly adj. 病态的
```

![](/hub/2019/November/67.jpeg)

My friend smiled gently and indulgently. "You see yourself," he said," that this is not a sheep. This is a ram. It has horns." So then I did my drawing over once more. 

```
词汇：
    1. gently adv. 温柔地
    2. indulgently adv. 溺爱地
    3. ram n. 公羊
    4. horn n. 角

But it was rejected too, just like the others. "This one is too old. I want a sheep that will live a long time."

By this time my patience was exhausted, because I was in a hurry to start taking my engine apart. So I tossed off（草草完成） this drawing. And I threw out（随口说） an explanation with it. "This is only his box. The sheep you asked for is inside." 

```
词汇：
    1. patience n. 耐心
    2. exhausted adj. 耗尽的
    3. tossed off 草草完成

I was very surprised to see a light break over the face of my young judge:

```

    1. suprised adj. 出人意料的
    2. break v. 绽放，break over the face 绽放在脸上
    3. judge n. 法官，裁判
```

"That is exactly the way I wanted it! Do you think that this sheep will have to have a great deal of grass?"

"Why?"

"Because where I live everything is very small..."

"There will surely be enough grass for him," I said. "It is a very small sheep that I have given you."

He bent his head over the drawing: "Not so small that-- Look! He has gone to sleep..." And that is how I made the acquaintance of the little prince.

```
语法：
    1. make an/ the acquaintance of sb 结识某人，这是种很书面的表达
```
