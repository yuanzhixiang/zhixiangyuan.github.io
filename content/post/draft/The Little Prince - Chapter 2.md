It took me a long time to learn where he came from. The little prince, who asked me so many questions, never seemed to hear the ones I asked him. It was from words dropped by chance that, little by little, everything was revealed to me.

The first time he saw my airplane, for instance (I shall not draw my airplane; that would be much too complicated for me), he asked me: "What is that object?"

```
词汇：
    1. saw 是 see 的过去式
    2. for instance 等于 for example 例如
```

"That is not an object. It flies. It is an airplane. It is my airplane." And I was proud to have him learn that I could fly.

```
词汇：
    1. flies 是 fly 的复数形式，原谅我第一眼看成 files \笑哭
```

He cried out, then: "What! You dropped down from the sky?"

```
词汇：
    1. cry out：to make a loud sound without words because you 
    are hurt, afraid, surprised, etc.
    2. drop down 掉下来
    3. sky 天空
```

"Yes," I answered, modestly.

```
词汇：
    1. modestly adv. 谦虚地，我觉得这理解成无奈地更符合场景
```

"Oh! That is funny!" And the little prince broke into a lovely peal of laughter, which irritated me very much. I like my misfortunes to be taken seriously.

```

    1. irritated v. 激怒
    2. misfortunes n. 不幸
语法：
    1. break into 自发地表达或说出

Then he added: "So you, too, come from the sky! Which is your planet?"

```
词汇：
    1. planet n. 星球
```

At that moment I caught a gleam of light in the impenetrable mystery of his presence; and I demanded abruptly: "Do you come from another planet?" But he did not reply. He tossed his head gently, without taking his eyes from my plane:

```
词汇：
    1. caught v. 捕捉 catch 的过去分词
    2. a gleam of 一丝

    9. gently adv. 轻轻地，温柔地
```

"It is true that on that you can't have come from very far away..." And he sank into a reverie, which lasted a long time. Then, taking my sheep out of his pocket, he buried himself in the contemplation of his treasure.

```
词汇：
    1. sink into 陷入，沉入
    2. reverie n. 幻想
    3. treasure n. 珍爱
语法：
    1. bury oneself in：bury 这个词原意是埋葬的意思，这是一种比较
    生动的说法，表明“这个人正忙着做某件事”。
    2. the contemplation of sth：对着某物深思
```

You can imagine how my curiosity was aroused by this half-confidence about the "other planets." I made a great effort, therefore, to find out more on this subject. "My little man, where do you come from? What is this 'where I live,' of which you speak? Where do you want to take your sheep?"

```
词汇：
    1. curiosity n. 好奇
    2. aroused 唤醒
```

After a reflective silence he answered: "The thing that is so good about the box you have given me is that at night he can use it as his house."

```
词汇：
    1. reflective adj. 沉思的
```

"That is so. And if you are good I will give you a string, too, so that you can tie him during the day, and a post to tie him to."

```
词汇：
    1. string n. 绳子
    2. tie...to... 把...与...系在一起
```

But the little prince seemed shocked by this offer:"Tie him! What a queer idea!"

```
词汇：
    1. shocked adj. 震惊的，shock 的过去式
    2. queer adj. 奇怪的
```

"But if you don't tie him," I said, "he will wander off somewhere, and get lost."

```
词汇：
    1. wander v. 迷路
```

My friend broke into another peal of laughter: "But where do you think he would go?"

"Anywhere. Straight ahead of him."

Then the little prince said, earnestly:"That doesn't matter. Where I live, everything is so small!"

```
词汇：
    1. earnestly adv. 认真地
```

And, with perhaps a hint of sadness, he added: "Straight ahead of him, nobody can go very far..." I had thus learned a second fact of great importance: this was that the planet the little prince came from was scarcely any larger than a house!

```
词汇：
    1. a hint of sadness 一丝悲伤
    2. scarcely 几乎没有
```

But that did not really surprise me much. I knew very well that in addition to the great planets-- such as the Earth, Jupiter（木星）, Mars（火星）, Venus（金星）-- to which we have given names, there are also hundreds of others, some of which are so small that one has a hard time seeing them through the telescope.

```
词汇：
    1. Jupiter 木星
    2. Mars 火星
    3. Venus 金星
    4. telescope n. 望远镜
```

When an astronomer discovers one of these he does not give it a name, but only a number. He might call it, for example, "Asteroid 3251." I have serious reason to believe that the planet from which the little prince came is the asteroid known as B-612.

```
词汇：
    1. astronomer n. 天文学家
    2. asteroid n. 小行星
```

This asteroid has only once been seen through the telescope. That was by a Turkish astronomer, in 1909. On making his discovery, the astronomer had presented it to the International Astronomical Congress, in a great demonstration. But he was in Turkish costume, and so nobody would believe what he said.

```
词汇：
    1. International Astronomical Congress 国际天文学家代表大会
    2. demonstration n. 示范，证明
    3. Turkish adj. 土耳其的
    4. costume n. 服装
```

Grown-ups are like that... Fortunately, however, for the reputation of Asteroid B-612, a Turkish dictator made a law that his subjects, under pain of death, should change to European costume. So in 1920 the astronomer gave his demonstration all over again, dressed with impressive style and elegance.

```
词汇：
    1. reputation n. 名声
    2. dictator n. 独裁者
    3. subjects n. 臣民
    4. impressive adj. 令人印象深刻的
    4. elegance n. 高雅
```

And this time everybody accepted his report. If I have told you these details about the asteroid, and made a note of its number for you, it is on account of the grown-ups and their ways. GROWN-UPS LOVE FIGURES.

```
词汇：
    1. if 这里的 if 感觉翻译成之所以更靠谱
    2. on account of 由于
    3. figures 数字
```

When you tell them that you have made a new friend, they never ask you any questions about essential matters. They never say to you, "What does his voice sound like? What games does he love best? Does he collect butterflies?"

```
词汇：
    1. essential adj. 基本的，必要的
    2. butterfly n. 蝴蝶
```

Instead, they demand:"How old is he? How many brothers has he? How much does he weigh? How much money does his father make?" Only from these figures do they think they have learned anything about him. If you were to say to the grown-ups:"I saw a beautiful house made of rosy brick, with geraniums in the windows and doves on the roof."

```
词汇：
    1. geraniums n. 天竺葵
    2. dove n. 鸽子
```

they would not be able to get any idea of that house at all. You would have to say to them: "I saw a house that cost $20,000."

Then they would exclaim: "Oh, what a pretty house that is!" Just so, you might say to them:

"The proof that the little prince existed is that he was charming, that he laughed, and that he was looking for a sheep. If anybody wants a sheep, that is a proof that he exists." And what good would it do to tell them that? They would shrug their shoulders, and treat you like a child.

```
词汇：
    1. exclaim v. 惊叫
    2. proof n. 证据
    3. charming adj. 可爱的
    4. shrug v. 耸肩
    5. shoulders n. 肩膀
    6. treat v. 对待
```

But if you said to them: "The planet he came from is Asteroid B-612," then they would be convinced, and leave you in peace from their questions. They are like that. One must not hold it against them. Children should always show great forbearance toward grown-up people.

```
词汇：
    1. forbearance n. 宽容
语法：
    1. leave sb in peace 不打扰某人，让某人平静，文中 leave you in peace from 
    their questions 可以理解为从他们的问题中逃脱出来，给自己留份清净。
```

But certainly, for us who understand life, figures are a matter of indifference. I should have liked to begin this story in the fashion of the fairy-tales. I should have liked to say:"Once upon a time there was a little prince who lived on a planet that was scarcely any bigger than himself, and who had need of a sheep..."

```
词汇：
    1. fairy-tales n. 神话
    2. a matter of indifference 无关紧要的事
```

To those who understand life, that would have given a much greater air of truth to my story. For I do not want any one to read my book carelessly，I have suffered too much grief in setting down these memories. Six years have already passed since my friend went away from me, with his sheep.

```
词汇：
    1. carelessly adv. 粗心地
    2. given a much greater air of truth 带来很强的真实性
    3. grief n. 悲痛
```

If I try to describe him here, it is to make sure that I shall not forget him. To forget a friend is sad. Not every one has had a friend. And if I forget him, I may become like the grown-ups who are no longer interested in anything but figures...

```
词汇：
    1. make sure 确保
语法：
    1. It is to 不定式表目的，这是为了...
```

It is for that purpose, again, that I have bought a box of paints and some pencils. It is hard to take up drawing again at my age, when I have never made any pictures except those of the boa constrictor from the outside and the boa constrictor from the inside, since I was six. I shall certainly try to make my portraits as true to life as possible.

```
词汇：
    1. portraits n. 肖像
    2. true to life 逼真
    3. as ... as possible 尽可能地
    4. take up 开始
```

But I am not at all sure of success. One drawing goes along all right, and another has no resemblance to its subject. I make some errors, too, in the little prince's height: in one place he is too tall and in another too short.

```
词汇：
    1. go along 进行
语法：
    1. have resemblance to sth 与某物相似，这里加了 no 表示不像
```

And I feel some doubts about the color of his costume. So I fumble（摸索） along as best I can, now good, now bad, and I hope generally fair-to-middling. In certain more important details I shall make mistakes, also.

```
词汇：
    1. costume n. 服装
    2. fumble v. 摸索
    3. fumble along 摸索前进，指画画过程
    4. fair-to-middling 差强人意
    5. generally adv. 通常
```

But that is something that will not be my fault. My friend never explained anything to me. He thought, perhaps, that I was like himself. But I, alas（哎）, do not know how to see sheep through the walls of boxes.

```
词汇：
    1. explained v. 解释，explain 的过去式以及过去分词
    2. thought v. 思考，认为，think 的过去式和过去分词
    3. through prep. 穿过
```

Perhaps I am a little like the grown-ups. I have had to grow old.
