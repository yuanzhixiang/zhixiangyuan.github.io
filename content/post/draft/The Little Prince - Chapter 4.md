On the fifth day-- again, as always, it was thanks to the sheep-- the secret of the little prince's life was revealed to me. Abruptly, without anything to lead up to it, and as if the question had been born of long and silent meditation on his problem, he demanded: "A sheep-- if it eats little bushes, does it eat flowers, too?"

```
1. thanks to 多亏，沉思
2. meditation n. 沉思
```

"A sheep," I answered, "eats anything it finds in its reach."

"Even flowers that have thorns?"

"Yes, even flowers that have thorns."

"Then the thorns-- what use are they?" I did not know. At that moment I was very busy trying to unscrew（取下） a bolt that had got stuck in my engine. I was very much worried, for it was becoming clear to me that the breakdown of my plane was extremely serious. And I had so little drinking-water left that I had to fear for the worst.

```
1. thorns n. 刺
2. unscrew v. 取下
3. bolt n. 螺丝
4. stuck adj. 卡住的
5. breakdown n. 故障
```

"The thorns-- what use are they?"

The little prince never let go of a question, once he had asked it. As for me, I was upset over that bolt. And I answered with the first thing that came into my head: "The thorns are of no use at all. Flowers have thorns just for spite!"

```
1. upset over 烦恼
2. spite n. 恶意 v. 刁难
```

"Oh!" There was a moment of complete silence. Then the little prince flashed back at me, with a kind of resentfulness（愤恨）: "I don't believe you! Flowers are weak creatures. They are naive. They reassure themselves as best they can. They believe that their thorns are terrible weapons..."

```
1. flashed v. 闪烁
2. resentfulness 愤恨
3. naive adj. 天真的
4. reassure v. 使安心
```

I did not answer. At that instant I was saying to myself: "If this bolt still won't turn, I am going to knock it out with the hammer." Again the little prince disturbed my thoughts. "And you actually believe that the flowers--"

```
1. instant adj. 立刻的，紧急的
2. disturbed v. 干扰
3. actually adj. 实际上，事实上
4. hammer n. 锤子
5. knock v. 敲
```

"Oh, no!" I cried. "No, no no! I don't believe anything. I answered you with the first thing that came into my head. Don't you see-- I am very busy with matters of consequence!" He stared at me, thunderstruck.

```
1. don't you see 难道你没看见么
2. matters of consequence 重要的事
3. thunderstruck adj. 遭雷击的，吓坏了的
4. bend down 蹲下
```

"Matters of consequence!"

He looked at me there, with my hammer in my hand, my fingers black with engine-grease, bending down over an object which seemed to him extremely ugly... "You talk just like the grown-ups!" That made me a little ashamed. But he went on, relentlessly（不屈不挠地）:

```
1. grease n. 油脂
2. relentlessly adj. 残酷地，无情地，不屈不挠地
3. extremely adv. 极端的
```

"You mix everything up together... You confuse everything..." He was really very angry. He tossed his golden curls in the breeze. "I know a planet where there is a certain red-faced gentleman.

```
1. tossed 扔
2. curls n. 卷发
3. breeze n. 微风
```

He has never smelled a flower. He has never looked at a star. He has never loved any one. He has never done anything in his life but add up figures. And all day he says over and over, just like you: 'I am busy with matters of consequence!'

```
1. add up 合计
2. over and over 一遍又一遍
```

And that makes him swell up with pride. But he is not a man-- he is a mushroom!"

"A what?"

"A mushroom!" The little prince was now white with rage. "The flowers have been growing thorns for millions of years. 

```
1. swell up 膨胀
2. pride n. 自豪
3. mushroom n. 蘑菇，这个词在英语里还表示固执己见又无知的人
4. white with rage （脸）气白了
5. turn from white to red （脸色）由白转红
```

For millions of years the sheep have been eating them just the same. And is it not a matter of consequence to try to understand why the flowers go to so much trouble to grow thorns which are never of any use to them? Is the warfare between the sheep and the flowers not important?

```
1. go to trouble 麻烦，费力
```

Is this not of more consequence than a fat red-faced gentleman's sums? And if I know-- I, myself-- one flower which is unique in the world, which grows nowhere but on my planet, but which one little sheep can destroy in a single bite some morning, without even noticing what he is doing-- Oh! You think that is not important!"

```
1. bite v. 咬
2. in a single bite 一口 
```

His face turned from white to red as he continued: "If some one loves a flower, of which just one single blossom grows in all the millions and millions of stars, it is enough to make him happy just to look at the stars.

He can say to himself, 'Somewhere, my flower is there...' But if the sheep eats the flower, in one moment all his stars will be darkened... And you think that is not important!" He could not say anything more. His words were choked by sobbing.

```
1. choked v. 喉咙卡住东西
2. sobbing 痛哭
```

The night had fallen. I had let my tools drop from my hands. Of what moment now was my hammer, my bolt, or thirst, or death? On one star, one planet, my planet, the Earth, there was a little prince to be comforted. I took him in my arms, and rocked him. I said to him:

```
1. of great moment adj. 重要的，事关重大的
2. of no moment adj. 无关紧要的
3. of what moment adj. 又有什么重要的
4. thirst v. 口渴
5. rock v. 摇晃
```

"The flower that you love is not in danger. I will draw you a muzzle for your sheep. I will draw you a railing to put around your flower. I will--" I did not know what to say to him. I felt awkward and blundering. I did not know how I could reach him, where I could overtake him and go on hand in hand with him once more.

```
1. muzzle n. 口套
2. railing n. 栏杆
3. awkward adj. 笨拙的
4. blundering adj. 粗笨的
5. overtake v. 赶上
```

It is such a secret place, the land of tears. I soon learned to know this flower better. On the little prince's planet the flowers had always been very simple. They had only one ring of petals; they took up no room at all;

```
1. tears n. 泪水
2. ring n. 环状
3. petals n. 花瓣
```

they were a trouble to nobody. One morning they would appear in the grass, and by night they would have faded peacefully away. But one day, from a seed blown from no one knew where, a new flower had come up; and the little prince had watched very closely over this small sprout which was not like any other small sprouts on his planet.

```
1. faded v. 枯萎
2. peacefully adv. 平静地
```

It might, you see, have been a new kind of baobab. But the shrub soon stopped growing, and began to get ready to produce a flower. The little prince, who was present at the first appearance of a huge bud, felt at once that some sort of miraculous apparition must emerge from it.

```
1. shrub n. 灌木
2. appearance n. 出现
3. bud n. 花蕾
4. felt
5. emerge from 从某处冒出来
6. miraculous adj. 不可思议的
7. apparition n. 幽灵
```

But the flower was not satisfied to complete the preparations for her beauty in the shelter of her green chamber. She chose her colours with the greatest care. She dressed herself slowly, she adjusted her petals one by one. She did not wish to go out into the world all rumpled, like the field poppies.

```
1. shelter n. 庇护
2. chamber n. 房间
3. colours n. 颜色，colour 的三单形式
4. rumpled adj. 凌乱的
5. poppies n. 罂粟花
```

It was only in the full radiance of her beauty that she wished to appear. Oh, yes! She was a coquettish（婀娜多姿的） creature! And her mysterious adornment（装饰） lasted for days and days.

```
1. radiance n. 容光焕发
2. coquettish adj. 婀娜多姿的
3. adornment n. 装饰
```
